what is DE ?
equation containing the derivatives of one or more dependent variables, with
respect to one or more independent variables, is said to be a differential equation
 
what is type of views to DE?
ODE / PDE
liner
by degree


methods to solve ODE using separation of variables

exact differential equation

Bernoulli differential equation

constant coefficient differential equations  m2 ,m1..

The auxiliary equation is


Differential operators 



what is CONDITION(S) OF  SIS  ?
NO death and No birth 
NO immunity

why do you use SIS ?

because you will  Know :
How epidemics spread
When  is people healed ?
The rate of increase in disease

solve SIS
here are no death and birthday
so that N = S + I = Canstant  where S => good people , I => bad people , N => all poeple
D S = - D I
D  I = -B 
alpha => rate of recovering
baytal => rate of infection

K= B-&
m=B/N
K ln c = ln z

s(0) number of people that good

DI = B/N (N- I) .I  - & I  = BN.I/N - BI.I/N  - & I = BI - BI.I/N  - & I
   = (B-&)I - B/N I.I                                                           let u  = I ^ -1 , I = u ^ -1 
                                                                                   DI = - u ^ -2  . Du
- u ^ -2  . Du =  (B-&) u ^ -1   -  B/N u ^ -2   * u ^ 2
 -Du =  (B-&) u   -  B/N                          
  Du =  -(B-&) u  +  B/N                      let K= B-&  m=B/N
  Du =  -k u  + m   
   du/ ( -k u  + m   )  = dt
  (-1/k) .  ln(  -k u  + m )  = t  + c

      ln(  -k u  + m ) = -kt +kc           let kc = ln z
      ln(  -k u  + m ) = -kt + ln z       
      -k u  + m = e ^ (-kt + ln z)  = e ^ (-kt) . z
      -k I ^ -1 + m =  e ^ (-kt) . z
      -k I ^ -1     =  e ^ (-kt) . z  - m
      -k / ( e ^ (-kt) . z  - m ) = I
      I =  k / (  m - e ^ (-kt) . z  )

relation between I and time ?

more people is high more  the number of infected people is more  

SIS AND COVID 19
if you Ignores immunity and Determine the fixed number of people
SIS will give you Rough numbers on the spread of the disease
