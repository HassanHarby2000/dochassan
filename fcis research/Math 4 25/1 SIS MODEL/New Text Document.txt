Definition: Differential Equation
An equation containing the derivatives of one or more dependent variables, with
respect to one or more independent variables, is said to be a differential equation

The order of the differential equation is the order of the highest derivative in the
equation.

Solution of an ODE:
Any function φ defined on an interval I and possessing at least n derivatives that
are continuous on I, which when substituted into an n-th-order ordinary differential
equation reduces the equation to an identity, is said to be a solution of the equation
on the interval.
In other words:
a solution of an nth-order ODE is a function φ that possesses at least n derivatives
and

for all x ∈ I. Alternatively we can denote the solution as y(x).
Interval of definition:
A solution of an ODE has to be considered simultaneously with the interval I which
we call
the interval of definition
the interval of existence,
the interval of validity, or
the domain of the solution.
It can be an open interval (a, b), a closed interval [a, b], an infinite interval (a, ∞)
and so on.
Example:
Verify that the function y = xex is a solution of the differential equation
y!! − 2y! + y = 0 on the interval (−∞, ∞):
From the derivatives
y
! = xex + ex
y
!! = xex + 2ex

that each side of the equation is the same for every real number x.
A solution that is identically zero on an interval I, i.e. y = 0, ∀x ∈ I, is said to be
trivial.
Example:
Verify that the function y = xex is a solution of the differential equation
y!! − 2y! + y = 0 on the interval (−∞, ∞):

Solution curve:
is the graph of a solution φ of an ODE.
The graph of the solution φ is NOT the same as the graph of the functions φ as
the domain of the function φ does not need to be the same as the interval I of definition (domain) of the solution φ.
Example:
Explicit solutions:
a solution in which the dependent variable is expressed solely in terms of the independent variable and constants.
Example:
y = φ(x) = e0.1 x2
is an explicit solution of the ODE
dy
dx = 0.2xy
Implicit solutions:
A relation G(x, y) = 0 is said to be an implicit solution of an ODE on an interval
I provided there exists at least one function φ that satisfies the relation as well as the
differential equation on I.
Example:
x2 + y2 = 25
is an implicit solution of the ODE
dy
dx = −x
y
on the interval (−5, 5).
Notice that also x2 + y2 − c = 0 satisfies the ODE above.
Families of solutions:
A solution φ of a first-order ODE F(x, y, y!
) = 0 can be referred to as an integral of
the equation, and its graph is called an integral curve.
A solution containing an arbitrary constant (an integration constant) c represents
a set
G(x, y, c) = 0
called a one-parameter family of solutions.
When solving an nth-order ODE F(x, y, y!
, ..., y(n)
) = 0, we seek an n-parameter
family of solutions G(x, y, c1, c2, ..., cn) = 0.
A single ODE can possess an infinite number of solutions!
A particular solution:
is a solution of an ODE that is free of arbitrary parameters.
Example:
y = cx − x cos x is an explicit solution of xy" − y = x2 sin x on (−∞, ∞).
The solution y = −x cos x is a particular solution corresponding to c = 0.
A singular solution:
a solution that can not be obtained by specializing any of the parameters in the
family of solutions.
Example:
y = (x2/4 + c)
2 is a one-parameter family of solutions of the DOE dy/dx = xy1/2.
Also y = 0 is a solution of this ODE but it is not a member of the family above.
It is a singular solution.
